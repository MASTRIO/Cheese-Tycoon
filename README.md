 Idk I tried making a game in python :/
 
 *Sooo, it turns out I'm turning this into a full game now... **Uh Oh***

# Installation
*There are three different ways to install this game*

**1. Download from release**
- Go to the releases section

**3. Compile from source**
- Make sure you have g++ installed
- Download the source code from either the releases section or via Github Desktop
- Open a terminal at the downloaded files location
- In the terminal run `g++ main.cpp -o JAGAC`
- Volia!
